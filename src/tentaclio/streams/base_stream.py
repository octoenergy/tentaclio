"""General note on streams and writers/readers.

We are using byte streams (writers and readers that only operate with byte arrays)
as canonical format to avoid a huge mess in string vs bytes duality.

We still allow client code open/write string data if they want to.
But that the actual data is always send to the under lying client (ftp, s3...) as bytes.

One of the reasons is that S3 only supports streams as binary data, which is not fully pythonic
(albeit being probably more sane).

In order to offer client code the possibility to write csv/parquet files into s3 buckets without
having to worry about the underlying implementations. We hide which stream flavour (string, bytes)
is used and only exposes the bytes versions to the S3Client.

This is down by using TextIOWrapper when text is needed by the client code and exposes the inner
buffer to the underlying client.
