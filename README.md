# Tentaclio

Python library that simplifies:
* Handling streams from different protocols such as `file:`, `ftp:`, `sftp:`, `s3:`, ...
* Opening database connections.
* Managing the credentials in distributed systems.

Main considerations in the design:
* Easy to use: all streams are open via `tentaclio.open`, all database connections through `tentaclio.db`.
* URLs are the basic resource locator and db connection string.
* Automagic authentication for protected resources.
* Extensible: you can add your own handlers for other schemes.
* Pandas interaction.

# Quick Examples.

## Read and write streams.
```python
import tentaclio
contents = "üëã üêô"

with tentaclio.open("ftp://localhost:2021/upload/file.txt", mode="w") as writer:
    writer.write(contents)

# Using boto3 authentication under the hood.
bucket = "s3://my-bucket/octopus/hello.txt"
with tentaclio.open(bucket) as reader:
    print(reader.read())
```

## Copy streams
```python
import tentaclio

tentaclio.copy("/home/constantine/data.csv", "sftp://constantine:tentacl3@sftp.octoenergy.com/uploads/data.csv")
```
## Delete resources
```python
import tentaclio

tentaclio.remove("s3://my-bucket/octopus/the-9th-tentacle.txt")
```
## List resources
```python
import tentaclio

for entry in tentaclio.listdir("s3:://mybucket/path/to/dir"):
    print("Entry", entry)
```

## Authenticated resources.
```python
import os

import tentaclio

print("env ftp credentials", os.getenv("OCTOIO__CONN__OCTOENERGY_FTP"))
# This prints `sftp://constantine:tentacl3@sftp.octoenergy.com/`

# Credentials get automatically injected.

with tentaclio.open("sftp://sftp.octoenergy.com/uploads/data.csv") as reader:
    print(reader.read())
```

## Database connections.
```python
import os

import tentaclio

print("env TENTACLIO__CONN__DB", os.getenv("TENTACLIO__CONN__DB"))

# This prints `postgresql://octopus:tentacle@localhost:5444/example`

# hostname is a wildcard, the credentials get injected.
with tentaclio.db("postgresql://hostname/example") as pg:
    results = pg.query("select * from my_table")
```

## Pandas interaction.
```python
import pandas as pd  # üêºüêº
import tentaclio  # üêô

df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30]], columns=["col_1", "col_2", "col_3"])

bucket = "s3://my-bucket/data/pandas.csv"

with tentaclio.open(bucket, mode="w") as writer:  # supports more pandas readers
    df.to_csv(writer, index=False)

with tentaclio.open(bucket) as reader:
    new_df = pd.read_csv(reader)

# another example: using pandas.DataFrame.to_sql() with tentaclio to upload
with tentaclio.db(
        connection_info,
        connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=schema_name'}
    ) as client:
    df.to_sql(
        name='observations', # table name
        con=client.conn,
    )
```

# Installation

You can get tentaclio using pip

```sh
pip install tentaclio
```
or pipenv
```sh
pipenv install tentaclio
```

## Developing.

Clone this repo and install [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

In the `Makefile` you'll find some useful targets for linting, testing, etc. i.e.:
```sh
make test
```


## How to use
This is how to use `tentaclio` for your daily data ingestion and storing needs.

### Streams
In order to open streams to load or store data the universal function is:

```python
import tentaclio

with tentaclio.open("/path/to/my/file") as reader:
    contents = reader.read()

with tentaclio.open("s3://bucket/file", mode='w') as writer:
    writer.write(contents)

```
Allowed modes are `r`, `w`, `rb`, and `wb`. You can use `t` instead of `b` to indicate text streams, but that's the default.


The supported url protocols are:

* `/local/file`
* `file:///local/file`
* `s3://bucket/file`
* `gs://bucket/file`
* `gsc://bucket/file`
* `gdrive:/My Drive/file`
* `googledrive:/My Drive/file`
* `ftp://path/to/file`
* `sftp://path/to/file`
* `http://host.com/path/to/resource`
* `https://host.com/path/to/resource`
* `databricks+pyodbc://hostname/database`
* `postgresql://host/database::table` will allow you to write from a csv format into a database with the same column names (note that the table goes after `::` :warning:).

You can add the credentials for any of the urls in order to access protected resources.


You can use these readers and writers with pandas functions like:

```python
import pandas as pd
import tentaclio

with tentaclio.open("/path/to/my/file") as reader:
    df = pd.read_csv(reader)

[...]

with tentaclio.open("s3::/path/to/my/file", mode='w') as writer:
    df.to_parquet(writer)
```
`Readers`, `Writers` and their closeable versions can be used anywhere expecting a file-like object; pandas or pickle are examples of such functions.

### File system like operations to resources
#### Listing resources
Some URL schemes allow listing resources in a pythonnic way:
```python
import tentaclio

for entry in tentaclio.listdir("s3:://mybucket/path/to/dir"):
    print("Entry", entry)
```

Whereas `listdir` might be convinient we also offer `scandir`, which returns a list of [DirEntry](https://github.com/octoenergy/tentaclio/blob/ddbc28615de4b99106b956556db74a20e4761afe/src/tentaclio/fs/scanner.py#L13)s, and, `walk`. All functions follow as closely as possible their standard library definitions.


### Database access

In order to open db connections you can use `tentaclio.db` and have instant access to postgres, sqlite, athena and mssql.

```python
import tentaclio

[...]

query = "select 1";
with tentaclio.db(POSTGRES_TEST_URL) as client:
    result =client.query(query)
[...]
```

The supported db schemes are:

* `postgresql://`
* `sqlite://`
* `awsathena+rest://`
* `mssql://`
* Any other scheme supported by sqlalchemy.

#### Extras for databases
For postgres you can set the variable `TENTACLIO__PG_APPLICATION_NAME` and the value will be injected
when connecting to the database.

### Automatic credentials injection

1. Configure credentials by using environmental variables prefixed with `TENTACLIO__CONN__`  (i.e.  `TENTACLIO__CONN__DATA_FTP=sfpt://real_user:132ldsf@ftp.octoenergy.com`).

2. Open a stream:
```python
with tentaclio.open("sftp://ftp.octoenergy.com/file.csv") as reader:
    reader.read()
```
The credentials get injected into the url.

3. Open a db client:
```python
import tentaclio

with tentaclio.db("postgresql://hostname/my_data_base") as client:
    client.query("select 1")
```
Note that `hostname` in the url to be authenticated is a wildcard that will match any hostname. So `authenticate("http://hostname/file.txt")` will be injected to `http://user:pass@octo.co/file.txt` if the credential for `http://user:pass@octo.co/` exists.

Different components of the URL are set differently:
- Scheme and path will be set from the URL, and null if missing.
- Username, password and hostname will be set from the stored credentials.
- Port will be set from the stored credentials if it exists, otherwise from the URL.
- Query will be set from the URL if it exists, otherwise from the stored credentials (so it can be
  overriden)

#### Credentials file

You can also set a credentials file that looks like:
```
secrets:
    db_1: postgresql://user1:pass1@myhost.com/database_1
    db_2: mssql://user2:pass2@otherhost.com/database_2?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server
    ftp_server: ftp://fuser:fpass@ftp.myhost.com
```
And make it accessible to tentaclio by setting the environmental variable `TENTACLIO__SECRETS_FILE`. The actual name of each url is for traceability and has no effect in the functionality.

(Note that you may need to add `?driver={driver from /usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini}` for mssql database connection strings; see above example)

Alternatively you can run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octoenergy/tentaclio/master/extras/init_tentaclio.sh` to create a secrets file in `~/.tentaclio.yml` and
automatically configure your environment.

## Configuring access to google drive.
Google drive support is _experimental_ and should be used at your own risk. Also, due to google drive itself it's rather slow.

1. Get the credentials.
First we need a credentials file in order to be able to generate tokens. The easiest way to do this is by going to [this example](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python),
click on enable drive api. Give the project a name of your choosing (eg `tentaclio`), set the OAuth
client selector to "Desktop app", and download the generated JSON file.

2. Generate token file

```
pipenv install tentaclio && \
    pipenv run python -m tentaclio google-token generate --credentials-file ~/Downloads/credentials.json
```
This will open a browser with a google auth page, log in and accept the authorisation request.
The token file has been saved in a default location '~/.tentaclio_google_drive.json'. You can also configure this via the env variable `TENTACLIO__GOOGLE_DRIVE_TOKEN_FILE`

3. Get rid of credentials.json
The `credentials.json` file is not longer need, feel free to delete it.


## Configuring access to Databricks

In order to use Tentaclio to connect to a Databricks cluster or SQL endpoint, it is necessary to install the required
[ODBC driver](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) for your operating system.

Once installed, it is possible to access Databricks as you would any supported URL protocol. However,
it is likely that you will have to pass some [additional variables](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html)
in the URL query string, including the path to the installed driver.

For example, if your Databricks connection requires you to set DRIVER and HTTPPATH values,
the URL should look like this:

```
databricks+pyodbc://<token>@<host>/<database>?DRIVER=<path/to/driver>&HTTPPath=<http_path>
```


## Quick note on protocols structural subtyping.

In order to abstract concrete dependencies from the implementation of data related functions (or in any part of the system really) we use typed [protocols](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocols.html#simple-user-defined-protocols). This allows a more flexible dependency injection than using subclassing or [more complex approches](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/413268/). This idea is heavily inspired by how this exact thing is done in [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifBUfIb7kdo). Learn more about this principle in our [tech blog](https://tech.octopus.energy/news/2019/03/21/python-interfaces-a-la-go.html).
